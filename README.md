# Portfolio
My own portfolio

I made this portifolio with the intention to integrade new features and improve it over time.

Features expected to be implemented: 

*Live chat (for this i intend to develop an android app to use on my phone.)
*Blog (My first post will be how i configured my portfolio using AWS services Route 53 and S3. Also how i used the WorkMail with my own domain )

Please feel free to get in contact even if just to give me a feedback about my work. I would really appreciate it. 

I would love to hear from you.

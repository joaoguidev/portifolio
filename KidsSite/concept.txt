I want my audience to fell joy and happyness. The audience of this project is small children.
Initially I was going to do a site where you could click on landscape photos and have a relaxing experience with sound and landscape videos. 
I decided to change my audience to children because I found good material for it so i changed.
I chose the fonts that looks handwritten. Similar to what you would find on board games. 
I tried to keep the visual identity clean and visually appealing at the same time. 
As soon as you enter the site you are presented with a landing page with a brief video that reveals the purpose of the project getting the user curious. 
The icons are large to instigate the user to click it and when he/she does there is a rewarding sound of a music box and the clicked animal spins reinforcing the notion that something of relevance happened. 
The Animal image gradually fades and in its place the animal video and sound appears. When the video ends the animal image reappears gracefully.
